                <p>In my second year of college, I was part of a team called WearTech, where we represented our school in a start-up app competition. 
                    I served as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO) and gained valuable experience in tech leadership and innovation.</p>

                <img src="./img/hult-prize-2.jpg" alt="Profile 2">
                <p>I truly enjoyed this experience because it not only taught me valuable

                <p>In my third year of college , I was unexpectedly elected as the Vice President for SDG
                     in our Supreme Student Council. It was my first time joining student leadership, and 
                     while the high position was initially overwhelming, I saw it as a great opportunity and embraced the challenge.

                <p>Although it was challenging, being a student leader turned out to be a truly rewarding experience. 
                    I discovered so much about myself and gained valuable insights through this journey.
                     I also had the chance to meet diverse individuals, each with unique dreams and aspirations in life.</p>

                <p>I also joined a Mobile Legends tournament at school, and my team was really 
                    strong—shoutout to my awesome classmates! We spent a week at the main campus 
                    in Alangilan for the tournament. Although we didn’t win, I had a lot of fun, 
                    laughed a lot, and grew as a team leader during that time.</p>

                <p>In my fourth year, I focused more on my journey as a programmer 
                    since our capstone project was approaching. As the programmer in our group, 
                    I went through countless sleepless nights coding, but by God's grace, 
                    I was able to execute the codes and fix the errors successfully. 
                    There were even times when I forgot a semicolon and spent almost two 
                    hours searching for it—haha! It was an amazing journey.</p>

                <p>By God's grace, we successfully defended our 
                    capstone project. It was such a fulfilling feeling to have developed an innovative 
                    solution through technology. It was incredibly stressful, though, and I ended 
                    up stress eating, which led to gaining some weight!</p>
